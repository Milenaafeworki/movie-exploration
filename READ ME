This analysis will review data provided by the client from IMDb and Box Office Mojo to create recommendations that Microsoft can use in their new business venture. In this project, total gross revenue was used to determine the success of a movie. This was the most logical choice with the data given, but other alternatives are discussed in the Future Work section.\n",

After exploring the relationship between genre and revenue to see which genre would have the greatest chance of return on investment the analysis showed that Crime movies have the greatest returns. ![Top Ten Directors](./images/Top ten directors revenue.png) ![Relationship between Genre and Revenue](./images/Genre with relation to revenue.png) Next was to investigate who were the directors and writers behind these genres making the most returns. Last but not least we all know the production budget also plays an important role in the overall financial return of a movie in the market. And here looking more into the relationship of the Budget and Revenu gives an ideal range of Budget of for Microsoft to get started on. ![User score with relation to revenue](./images/Score with relation to revenue.png)"
